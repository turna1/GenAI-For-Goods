# Generative AI for Challenging Dataset Generation

## Overview

The core objective of this repository is to delve deep into the realm of Generative AI, focusing primarily on its capability to generate synthetic datasets. This is especially beneficial in scenarios where traditional data collection is not only challenging but potentially impossible for instance- defect data, and confidential data. Through advanced Generative AI techniques, our mission is to bridge this gap and provide solutions where creativity and synthesis in data generation are applicable.

In essence, this repository may serve as a repository for researchers and innovators to modify, fine-tune, and explore the proposed/ applied approaches further. Our aim is to produce more diverse synthetic datasets that can replicate the complexity of real-world data landscapes.

## Features
