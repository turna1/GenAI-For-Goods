1. **Reasons for Lack of  Datasets**:
   - **Time-Intensive Data Collection**: Particularly when manual annotation is needed.
   - **Privacy Concerns**: Difficulty in sharing raw data containing sensitive personal information.

2. **Solution: Generating Synthetic Data**
   - **Advances in Generative Models**: Recent progress allows for the creation of realistic synthetic data that mimics complex real data.
   - **Applications**:
     - **Augmenting Training Data**: Useful when there's a shortage of labeled data, helping to prevent overfitting.
     - **Privacy Protection**: Sharing synthetic data instead of original data, maintaining utility while ensuring privacy.

3. **Challenges in Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Despite its benefits, creating high-quality synthetic data is a complex, ongoing technical challenge.
    - limited data availability and privacy concern
    - ensuring quality and fairness
     

**Paper text:**
One of the reasons for the lack of rich datasets is the substantial amount of time needed for data collection, especially when manual annotation is required. Another reason is the need for protecting privacy, whenever raw data contains sensitive information about individuals and hence cannot be shared directly. A powerful solution that can address both of these challenging scenarios is generating synthetic data. Thanks to the recent advances in generative models, it is possible to create realistic synthetic samples that closely match the distribution of complex, real data. In the case of limited labeled data, synthetic data can be used to augment training data to mitigate overfitting. In the case of protecting privacy, data curators can share the synthetic data instead of the original data, where the utility of the original data is preserved but privacy is protected. Despite the substantial benefits from using synthetic data, the process of synthetic data generation is still an ongoing technical challenge. Although the two scenarios of limited data and privacy concerns share similar technical challenges such as quality and fairness, they are often studied separately.
